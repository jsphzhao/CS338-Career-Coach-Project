If you've lost your job recently, you might be going through a hard time. Driven is a program to help you cope with the stress of being unemployed and provide you with the skills you need to find a new job. Driven is a six week program developed by career counselors and professors at Northwestern University. You'll spend a few hours in the app each week. We start each new week of the program on a Sunday, because we know that can be a tough day of the week for some people, and we want to help you get the best possible start to your week. Here's how it works. First, you'll answer a few questions about your mood so we can see how you're doing. Then",

Then you'll watch three short videos and complete two exercises. You'll do these activities while working with a career coach for now or every other week on your personal career goals. The exercises in this program use techniques taken from psychology to change attitudes, habits and actions. Research has shown that changing thoughts and taking actions can help people make positive changes in their lives. Over the next six weeks, you'll learn how to think more flexibly and take positive steps towards searching for and getting a job. In this week's videos, I'll start with an overview of the program and some core ideas we'll use throughout it. In weeks two through five, my colleagues, Victor Joanna and I will share some of our best strategies for landing your next job,",

How to build your own skills based on what companies are looking for, how to write your resume and apply to jobs that are right for you, how to nail the job interview. And follow up professionally, and in the final week, I'll review everything we've covered so far. With your new skills, you'll be ready to overcome any job search related problems that come your way.

First, let's talk about why it's important to manage emotions when you have a difficult task ahead of you, like applying for jobs or preparing for interviews, having negative emotions like anxiety, can lower your motivation to get things done. Here's something I find interesting, the way we think about a situation can influence how we feel about it. Changing the actions we take and reducing bad habits can shift how we feel too. In other words, if we want to change the way we feel. We need to make changes to the way we think and act. Now, let's talk about our thoughts. Sometimes these can be",

For example, we might believe that a bad situation or event is causing us to feel upset or angry, but if events always led to feelings, then everyone would be affected the same way. But we know from experience that this isn't true. Let's say you and your co worker were both laid off. You might feel disappointed because you thought that the job was a good fit for your skills and that the company was doing well, while your co worker might feel relieved because they had been thinking of going after new career opportunities, same event, different thoughts, different reactions.

If you tell yourself that you will never find another job as great as the one you lost, you might feel sadness and helplessness, but if you tell yourself something else like it may be difficult, but eventually I'll find a good job for me, and maybe it will be even better than the last one, you might feel more optimistic and ready to move on, even if a situation appears to be 100% bad, there's always another way of looking at it.

Now complete the exercise on flexible thinking, you'll have the chance to review it with your coach at the end of the week. Exercise 1 Exercise 1 blurb: Thinking flexibly involves seeing situations from different points of view. In this exercise, think about a recent event that caused you to feel down, upset, or stressed. Then use the prompts to come up with your thoughts about the situation, and brainstorm other ways you might think about the situation. Exercise 1 questions: a.

Alternate viewpoints (How might your coach see the situation?) Section 3 Video 3 I hope you found the exercise on flexible thinking helpful. Now it's time to talk about the next part of the equation, which is action. When we're feeling down about a negative event like a breakup or a job ending, we might want to sit on the couch and mope while we wait for motivation to come our way. We might isolate ourselves and avoid taking action, and this often makes us feel worse. In other words, it's a vicious cycle. For example, let's say",

You tell yourself that you'll do these things later once you wake up. Unfortunately, after sleeping a few more hours, you're still tired and even less motivated. Research has shown that taking action or doing something that's in line with our goals breaks us out of the cycle and helps us feel better.

Your list can include activities that help drive your job search and ones that are purely fun and relaxing. In fact, it's helpful to have a mix of both.
